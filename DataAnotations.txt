Assume name of tables is plural of class name (What EF does)
use [Table("tbl course", Schema = "Catalogue")]
if the schema is not default

col names are same as properties
use [Column("sName", TypeName = "varchar")]
This will chance the name to sName and the type to varchar (rather than nvarchar)

other examples follow a similar notation (Primary key etc....)
for composite keys, add [key] to both properties
[Required]

Len of strings:
EF assumes the len is MAX
[MaxLength(255)]

index:
[Index("Name of index", Order(1,2,3...), IsUnique = True)]
Creates a unique index

foreign keys:
Link the columns, one which relies on the other. Apply foreignkey attributes and specify the navigation prooperty
Refer to the course
